## üìì Overview

- This repository contains the source code for the task that was given as part of Atlan's frontend hiring challenge.

- The objective was to build a SQL Editor in any JS framework of your choice. I have used React and Typescript. Users should be able to run queries on a set of tables and later export the result as a csv file. 

- As a fun learning exercise, I decided to create my own editor that is capable of parsing and running basic SQL queries.

- The script that has been used here can accept simple select queries with the SELECT and WHERE keywords, followed by any number of conditions (Basic comparisons with <, >, =, <=, >= etc). You can also run queries with the ORDER BY keyword for sorting records w.r.t a given column. 

- There are many limitations to this method, and in a real world scenario, one would have to use a proper editor for writing and running SQL queries.

- The app has been deployed on Netlify and can be found [here](https://dulcet-maamoul-2cd9df.netlify.app/)

- Examples of queries that can be run in this app are shown below (see screenshots)
